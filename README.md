This application is a simple client/server 
hello world service.  It is based on the following content:

https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-grpc-java/index.html

Unfortunately, when I tried to build the source, it failed.  So, I've corrected
the issues...  Hopefully, it will be helpful to others...
